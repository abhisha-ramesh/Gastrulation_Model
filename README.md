# A Physical Model of Drosophila VFF
This project simulates Drosophila Ventral Furrow Formation using Cellular Potts Model(aka Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg) framework using the [CompuCell3D(CC3D)](https://github.com/CompuCell3D/CompuCell3D) simulation software. This README file provides instructions on how to setup, run and modify this simulation using CC3D simulation environment. 

## Installing CC3D
The latest version of CC3D can be downloaded and installed from the [official website](https://compucell3d.org/) (supported on Windows, Mac and Linux). Simulations can be executed using [CompuCell3D Player](https://github.com/CompuCell3D/cc3d-player5/tree/master).

## How to run and modify simulation?
The simulation is stored in the folder _Gastrulation_code_ containing a .cc3d project file and a directory called Simulation where one can find all the Python Scripts. To load a simulation in CC3D Player or into [Twedit++](https://github.com/CompuCell3D/cc3d-twedit5/tree/master) (IDE for CC3D), use the .cc3d file. The simulation can be modified by loading the python scripts into Twedit++.
